## 1. Introduction

Welcome to ShitcoinWC, the revolutionary platform designed to cleanse the cryptocurrency market of underperforming assets, affectionately termed "shitcoins," and convert them into GSHT tokens. Our playful yet powerful platform turns your crypto regrets into valuable assets, creating a cleaner and more prosperous crypto ecosystem.

## 2. Mission Statement

ShitcoinWC's mission is to cleanse the cryptocurrency ecosystem by providing a decentralized platform where investors can transform their underperforming or "shitcoin" investments into a more stable and promising asset, the GSHT token. We aim to create value from the forgotten corners of digital wallets, fostering a community-driven approach to cryptocurrency investment.

## 3. Core Components

### Shitcoin Depository Contract

- **Purpose**: A smart contract where users deposit their selected shitcoins.
- **Functionality**: Accepts a wide range of ERC-20 tokens (with plans to expand to other standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155).
- **Security Measures**: Features like reentrancy guards and checks for abnormal transaction patterns ensure security and integrity.

### Flush Mechanism

- **Trigger**: Any user can initiate the flush, converting accumulated shitcoins into ETH or BNB through a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap or PancakeSwap.
- **Frequency**: Controlled to prevent market manipulation, with a cooldown period between flushes.

### Distribution Algorithm

- **Buyback of GSHT Tokens**: 90% of converted assets buy back GSHT tokens from the market, supporting the token's value.
- **Reward for Top Contributors**: 10% of assets are rewarded to top contributors based on their deposited shitcoins.

### GSHT Tokenomics

- **Supply**: Finite supply ensures scarcity and value appreciation over time.

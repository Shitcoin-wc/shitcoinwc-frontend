            "answer": "It's your crypto portfolio's redemption arc. Ever stared at those tokens from hyped ICOs that now haunt your wallet like ghosts of bad decisions? ShitcoinWC is a magical portal (disguised as a toilet) where you dump those tokens, and voil√† - out comes something far less shitty: GSHT."
